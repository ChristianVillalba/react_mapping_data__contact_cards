## Description
This app renders a heading "My contacts"        
and 3 cards with information of 3 humans: their name, a picture, their (fake) telephone and their (fake) email

## What I have learned with this project: 
* How to apply styles to the components
* Extract Components to make them reusable
* Import modules (from contacts.js) to create Card Componets using the data there as values in the props.
